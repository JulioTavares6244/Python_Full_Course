# 🐍 Python Full Course 🖥️

Welcome to my **Python Full Course**! 🎉

This is where I'm documenting my journey as I **re-learn Python** by following an awesome YouTube series! 📚

---

### 🎯 **Why am I doing this?**
I learned Python 🐍 about **4 years ago**, but for the last few years, I've mostly been using **SQL**, **DAX**, and **M (PowerQuery Language)** in my daily work. 

➡️ So, guess what? I’ve forgotten a lot of the **basics of Python**!  
And honestly, I’m not ashamed to admit it — I’m excited to **start fresh** and learn it all again! 🔄

### ✏️ **What’s happening here?**
Here, I’ll be keeping all the `.py` files 📂 I create during the course and linking the [**video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix9cRaBkVe0&t=164s) 🎥 I’m watching along the way.

The course is from the YouTube channel [**Bro Code**](https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez) and has been a huge help in my journey to getting back into Python! 🚀

Be sure to **give him a thumbs-up 👍** and **subscribe** for more great content!  
And if you're learning Python too, good luck with your studies! 💪💡

Happy Coding! 😄
